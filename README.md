# medicine-tracking-system

This is a fifth-year school project to demonstrate the use of blockchain for the purpose of tracking medicine through the pharmaceutical supply chain.

The Medicine Tracking System (MTS) tracks the movement of medicine through the medical supply chain. It implements blockchain technology to track the transactions through the supply chain, providing an immutable record that can be used to track anormalies.

The concept it simple: The medicine is tracked from the manufacturer all the way to the consumer, patient. Evey transaction is entered into the system: be it a sale, a purchase or a delivery.
